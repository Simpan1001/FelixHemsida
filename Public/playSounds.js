We could start over Just look me in the eyes And say I'm wrong Now there's only emptiness Venomous, insipid I think we're done I'm not the only oneAnd the rain will kill us all Throw ourselves against the wall But no one else can see The preservation of the martyr in me Psychosocial (x6) The limits of the dead (x4) Fake anti-fascist lie (psychosocial) I tried to tell you, but (psychosocial) Your purple hearts are giving out (psychosocial) Can't stop a killing idea (psychosocial) If it's hunting season (psychosocial) Is this what you want?
